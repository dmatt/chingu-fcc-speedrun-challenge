# Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage

## Objective

Build an app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/YqLyXB/.

## Requirements

User Story: I can access all of the portfolio webpage's content just by scrolling.

User Story: I can click different buttons that will take me to the portfolio creator's different social media pages.

User Story: I can see thumbnail images of different projects the portfolio creator has built (if you haven't built any websites before, use placeholders.)

User Story: I navigate to different sections of the webpage by clicking buttons in the navigation.

## Notes

Code is available at [https://github.com/dmatt/dmatt.github.io](https://github.com/dmatt/dmatt.github.io)

This single page portfolio is created within a static site built with [Jekyll](https:://jekyll.com) and [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/). Each project within the portfolio is simply a blog post with the following small tweaks:

- projects are organized into different categories to allow seprate anchors on the page
- the projects page layout has a header that links to each anchor
- the projects page layout has thumbnails next to each blog post to provide a visual

TODO:

- [ ] Improve the design of the projects page layout by using a grid and making thumnails larger, and post descriptions smaller
- [ ] Add an "about" section at the top above the projects grid
