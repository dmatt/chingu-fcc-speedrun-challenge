# Build a Wikipedia Viewer

## Objective

Build an app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/wGqEga/.

## Requirements

* User Story: I can search Wikipedia entries in a search box and see the resulting Wikipedia entries.

* User Story: I can click a button to see a random Wikipedia entry.

**Hint #1:** Here's a URL you can use to get a random Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random.

**Hint #2:** Here's an entry on using Wikipedia's API: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page.

**Hint #3:** Use this link to experiment with Wikipedia's API.

## Notes

TODO:

- [ ] a nice search bar
- [ ] realtime search suggestions and autocomplete
- [ ] a calousel set for interesting wikipedia articles for that day to kickstart interest
- funny button for Random wiki article view
- clicking article opens a short description
  - clicking linked keyword in short description (re-searches & displays) new term description
  - tracks deepness 
- donate link (counter?)

TODO (nice to haves):

Components:

- main page un-searched
- dropdown during search
  - results and no results state
- displayed article & description with CTA new window
- carousel initial interesting results
- deepness counter (local storage) with animation transition

Design ideas:

- desktop and mobile
- corousel is swipey on mobile
- Search and results look nice on mobile
